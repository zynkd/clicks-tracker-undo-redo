# Clicks Tracker With Undo & Redo Buttons

The following project will aim to solve the following challenge:
- Develop a React-based application that allows users to leave dots on the screen by clicking on it
- Dots should have a fixed size of 12 pixels by 12 pixels
- Provide functionality to undo the last dot placement by the user
    - The undo button can be clicked multiple times until all previous dots are removed
- Provide functionality to redo previously undone dot placements
    - The redo button can be clicked multiple times until all dots are restored
- Clearly label and easily accessible undo and redo buttons
- Ensure a smooth, intuitive, and responsive user experience
- Use Typescript to make application more robust
